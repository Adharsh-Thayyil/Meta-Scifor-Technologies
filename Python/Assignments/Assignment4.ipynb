Recently he came to know about the BMI report, and now he wants to calculate his own BMI by writing a python program. Write a program in python to check your BMI by putting your height and weight as input. ● Note: ● Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared. A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years."
