According to the rule, only that essay should be checked which contains at least 250 words. Teachers were just guessing the number of words in the essay but that was not an accurate way to count the number of words. So write a program that can count the number of words in an essay ( Hint: Take input and count the number of words using for loop | Note: to count the number of words you can just count the number of blank spaces given in the input. )"
